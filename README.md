# DestinyDocs
Included is all my documentation on destiny game files, particularly for recent versions of Destiny 2. I've also migrated the Charm wiki to here as GitHub does not support PRs for it.

## Contents

### Charm
* [Home](Charm/Home) (overview)
* [Development](Charm/Development) (how to help make it better)
* [UE5 Interoperability](Charm/UE5-Interoperability) (how to use Charm with UE5)

### Destiny Engine (very wip)
* [Engine overview](Destiny-Engine/Engine-overview) (what the engine is, how it stores and parses cache "tag" files)
* [Tag formats](Destiny-Engine/Tag-formats) (explanations of formats of the types of tags in the game)
