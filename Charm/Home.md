This wiki hosts the documentation for Charm as well as my documentation for the Destiny 2 game files.

### I want to learn how to use Unreal Engine 5 with Charm

The [UE5 interop tutorial page](UE5-Interoperability) will be helpful.

### I want to contribute to Charm

You can skip everything about the engine. Best place to start is to look at the [Issues](https://github.com/MontagueM/Charm/issues) tab, and look through the [Charm Development page](Development).

### I want to learn how Destiny 2 files works from the ground up

You'll want the [Destiny Engine](../Destiny-Engine/Engine-overview.md) page.
