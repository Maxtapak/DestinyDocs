# Maps

## Terrain

The terrain for maps is made up of a few different files. The first comes from the 7th map resource in 07878080 (maybe can be others idk). This is an entity arrangement file type 83988080, but has a special attachment type which stores a resource with the terrain arrangement coordinates and a terrain data file type 816C8080. This stores all the information to get the terrain model out including materials.
